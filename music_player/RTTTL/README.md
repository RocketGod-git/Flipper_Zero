# FlipperMusicRTTTL
Selection of RTTTL .txt files that will work with the FIipperZero Music Player. 

Create a "music_player" folder on the root of the SD card, place files inside that folder.
Subdirectories are currently not supported on the latest build.

Make sure you are downloading the .txt file and not a .html for them to work.

Feel free to add or make any changes.

Adding a new folder called "ArcadeTones", it will contain newer additions.

When using RingtoneComposer make sure you are exporting as an RTTTL and not saving as a txt file.

SendTone is usuful for minor edits and is very similar to nokring.

Nokring is best for composing from scratch, also good for edits.
