`Version: 0.8`
  `Total: 69 Files`

**!! I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THESE LINKS/VIDEOS !!**

This is my first GitHub Repo, please don't blame :)

You know any other site or want to share a video/website too?

- [GitHub @w0lfzk1nD](https://github.com/w0lfzk1n)
- [Discord Toxic_Wolf#2468]

## ==Infos==

- *I am german, so i will add some german things as well, every german file will be noted with GER*
- *Please remove and don't use the 3 files that have been removed. Blankwindows , OneMillionLOL , Win_93!*
- *Please let me know about any improvement or change i sould consider*

## How to add?
Place the folder/s or file/s onto the SD-Cards folder for NFC, used by your Flipper.

É voila :D 

Launch them on your Flipper, hold it near a device with NFC turned on and watch :D 

## What?

I collected a few websites and videos i tought, it might be worth to have them in your pocket when you are around :)

Trolls // Funny stuff // Weird stuff // Helpful stuff

Using Android, i wrote the links to empty NTAG_213BIT emulated by Flipper Zero.

## How to create myself?

Here i will show you, how you can create your own NFC Tags like this. I will just referr to my situation, but this should show how to do it.

**Requirements**

- Mobile Phone with NFC App to write    *(Android in my case)*
- Flipper Zero
- PC with qFlipper

1. Download the Xempty_213.nfc or any NFC Tag that fits you and put it on the Flipper's SD.

2. Open the NFC app (no specific app to mention, just search one that can WRITE) and emulate writing the link you want to have as NFC.

3. Emulate the NFC tag with your Flipper and hold it on the phone until it's success.

4. Go to qFlipper and navigate, where you have saved the tag you have written to

5. Rename the NEW file that has the same name *ex Xempty.shd* and put **.nfc** on the end

6. Enjoy your NFC Tag :D

*MAY YOUR PHONE DOES NOT SUPPORT NFC OR NFC WRITING, PLEASE INFORM YOURSELF AND DON'T ASK ME ABOUT THIS*
